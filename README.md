# Glsl2DGen
A library (C++ and C#) to allow generating 2d bitmaps using multiple glsl shaders.

<i>Note: This is completely function, but there is much room for improvement.</i>

<h2>Backlog</h2>
<li>Setup java bindings</li>
<li>Add 'getShaderOutput' method to get the shader-compile output from the previous 'addShader' call</li>
<li>C++ dll contains both the class and functions.  Adjust C++ test to use class instead of functions.</li>
<li>Setup for crossplatform / Linux use (how to do this with C# component?)</li>
